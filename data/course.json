  "course_description": "In this course you will learn the three laws of thermodynamics, explore concepts like entropy and enthalpy, and investigate the causes and effects of global warming from a thermodynamics perspective. We will also apply these concepts to learning about state-of-the-art energy conversion and storage technologies, for example heat pumps, hydrogen fuel cells, metal-air batteries, artificial photosynthesis, molten salt storage, and concentrated solar power.\u00a0\n\nThis course was offered as part of {{% resource_link \"5cc00e44-dede-4bff-8d38-8ddddea01954\" \"MITES Semester\" %}} (formerly MOSTEC) in Summer 2022. MITES Semester is a 6-month online program for rising high-school seniors. The program offers students an opportunity to learn about diverse science and engineering fields, strengthen their academic STEM foundation, build 21st-century skills in networking, interviewing, collaboration and presentation delivery, prepare for college, and build a strong community of peers and mentors.\n\nMITES Semester is part of {{% resource_link \"c6004c6a-4642-43f7-932b-4def5016b6b3\" \"MIT Introduction to Technology, Engineering, and Science (MITES)\" %}}, which provides transformative experiences that bolster confidence, create lifelong community, and build an exciting, challenging foundation in STEM for highly motivated 7th\u201312th grade students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds.",
